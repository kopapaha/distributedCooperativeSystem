wireless sensor networks

distributed cooperative system:
1.sending query from host(PC)/source to all nodes/workers
2.workers do their job and submit result to neighbourhood workers
3.each worker aggregate results (waits for the rest path) and disseminate back
avoiding collisions via pseudorandom backoff interval


programming language: nesC
operating system: tinyOS
simulation: TOSSIM
real lab tests: "intel Mote 2" wireless sensor nodes
